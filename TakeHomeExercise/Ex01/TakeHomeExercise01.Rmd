# 1.0 Introduction

In this take home exercise of two parts, a Pareto chart visualizing the proportion of returns from each sub-category of products from a superstore and a Age-Sex pyramid based on 2021 Singapore population data will be created with R code and ggplot functions. Both of which were previously created in tableau. In both parts steps taken to load, wrangle and tidy the data as well as steps to generate the visualization will be documented. Towards the end of this article, a comparison between creating the plots with R and tableau will be made.

# 2.0 Loading Required packages

Prior to processing the data, required packages are loaded. **Tidyverse** will be the main package that used be used to wrangle the data and generate visualizations. **readxl** package is loaded to read superstore data as it is in Microsoft Excel format. **rmarkdown** package is loaded to display data in a page table format for inspection.

```{r loading-packages}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'readxl', 'rmarkdown')

for(p in packages){library
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# 3.0 Generating a store returns Pareto Chart.

A [Pareto chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart) consist of a bar graph representing the number of occurrences in each individual category and a line graph showing the corresponding cumulative percentage of total occurrences across the categorues. 

To visualize the returns by sub category, transaction data of each order from a superstore will be used. Some data wrangling would be required as the original data represents the order information and returned orders in two separate excel spreadsheets. After joining the data, the occurrences of returns and the cumulative percentage across the sub category would have to be calculated.

Steps performed to transform and visualize the data are documented below.

## Loading the data

Firstly the data is loaded in Rstudio.

The data required for this visualization is stored in two separate spreadsheets of the data file. Following the readxl package read_xls function syntax, the data is read into two separate tibble format.  

```{r loading-Data}
orders <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls", sheet = "Orders")
returns <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls", sheet = "Returns")
```

## Data Wrangling

Following a left_join is performed to joined the returns data with the orders data based on 'Order ID' attribute in both tables as stored as joined_tab tibble.

```{r joining-Data}
joined_tab <- left_join(returns, orders, by = c('Order ID' = 'Order ID'))
```

Next the number orders returned per sub category is calculated using dpylr group_by method to group the orders by sub-category and summarize method to count the number of returned ordered per sub-category. The results are stored as tibble freq_returned.

```{r summarising Data - bar chart}
freq_returned <- joined_tab %>% 
  group_by(`Sub-Category`) %>% 
  summarise('Returns' = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

The data will be visualized in descending order, counts of returns from the previous step is sorted accordingly using arrange method.

```{r summarising Data - cumulative Chart - 1}
freq_sorted <- freq_returned %>% 
  arrange(desc(Returns)) 

```

Cumulative sum of returns across the sub-categories is calculated to generate the line graph.

```{r summarising Data - cumulative Chart - 2}
freq_cum <-  freq_sorted %>% 
  mutate(cumfreq = cumsum(Returns))
```

In the following code chunk the Sub-Category attribute is converted to factor data type with the levels based on the current sorted position in the data table. This is done to preserve the sub category order when visualizing the data otherwise it would be arrange in alphabetical order when plotted using ggplot methods.

```{r summarising Data - cumulative Chart - 3}
freq_cum$`Sub-Category` <-factor(freq_cum$`Sub-Category`, levels = freq_cum$`Sub-Category`)
```

A final check on the data result prior to visulizing the data.

```{r preview-Data, echo = TRUE}
paged_table(freq_cum)
```

## Data visualization (Pareto Chart)

To visualize the Pareto chart a bar graph and a line graph would be created. ggplot provides two main methods to produce bar charts geom_bar and geom_col. The main difference between the two is geom_bar has build in function to summarize the data according to a specified statistic. Since the values of each bar is calculated in the prior step, geom_col will be used instead without need for additional calculation.

The geom_line method is used to create the line graph and geom_point to add individual points since the cumulative values have been calculated.

The data is visualized using ggplot grammar of visualizations methods in below code chunk. The layers are added accordingly to the steps in the list below:

* a ggplot object is initialized with the freq_cum table as the data to be used. Since Sub-Category will be used commonly among the layers it is assign the x-axis aesthetic field.
* geom_col layer is added by specifying count of returns on to the y axis.  
* geom_point layer is added next. In this instance the cumulative count of returns across the sub categories is assigned to y-axis.
* geom_line layer is added using the cumfreq as the y variable and assigning all the data to one group to join the points with a line.
* geom_hline is added as a reference line to highlight the 80% point of the line chart.
* Appropriate labels for the title and x axis is added.
* Secondary axis to read the line features is also added.
* Various theme adjustment such as changing background to white and lighter grey grid lines. to enhance readability of features


```{r generate pareto chart, layout="l-page",  fig.width = 15, fig.asp = 0.618, fig.align='center'}

ggplot(freq_cum, aes(x=`Sub-Category`, y = cumfreq)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = Returns), fill = "lightblue", color = "grey") +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumfreq, group = 1), color = "black") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8*max(freq_cum$cumfreq), color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  ggtitle("Pareto of Returns") +
  xlab("Sub Categories") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Absolute Frequency", 
                     breaks = as.integer(seq(0, 1.0, by = 0.1)*max(freq_cum$cumfreq)),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~./max(freq_cum$cumfreq), 
                                         breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 0.1),
                                         labels = scales::percent)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                      color = "black",
                                      linetype = "solid"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.25,
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "lightgrey"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.10,
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "lightgrey"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y.right = element_text(angle=90))

```

# 4.0 Generating a Age-Sex pyramid

In this part of the exercise, a [Age-Sex pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid) will be generated. Population data of Singapore in 2021 obtain from [Singapore Department of Statistics](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme?theme=society&type=visualising-data) Website will be used. 

The data source stores the data, with greater level of detail than needed for a static Age-Sex pyramid chart. Prior to creating the visualization, the data would be aggregate into age-group segments for both genders. 

ggplot does not have a native method to create a Age-Sex pyramid, a workaround would be required. As the Age-Sex pyramid is similar to a bar graph the geom_col method would be used, the population values for one of the genders would be converted to negative values such that it would appear below an axis. The graph is then flipped such that it is similar to a pyramid. The axis values are then overwritten to remove the negative values.

Steps to wrangle the data and create the visualization are listed below.

## Loading Data

The data is saved in csv format, dplyr read_csv method will be used.

```{r loading data-population}
pop2021 <- read_csv("data/respopagesextod2021.csv")
```

## Data Wrangling

Population size for each age group and gender is first summarized using dplyr group_by and summarize methods. 

```{r generate gender cols}
pop2021_grouped <- pop2021 %>% 
  group_by(AG, Sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(Pop)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

In the following code chunk one of values "5_to_9" in attribute AG is changed to "05_to_9" to allow for ggplot default labels to arrange the data according to age group. If not the values would be placed among the 50s group data.

```{r rename age group}
pop2021_grouped <- pop2021_grouped %>% mutate(AG = case_when(AG == "5_to_9" ~ "05_to_9",
                                            TRUE ~ AG))
```

By default geom_col method in ggplot would stack the values of groups if a variable is assigned to the fill aesthetic. To work around this, the population values for all Male age groups is converted to negative values first. Such that when the chart is generated population values for males will fall below the axis. Axis label is later manually overwritten to replace negative values as suggested by [this](https://rpubs.com/walkerke/pyramids_ggplot2)  rpubs article 

```{r generate male numbers edit}
pop2021_grouped <- pop2021_grouped %>% mutate(Pop2 = case_when(Sex == "Males" ~ 0-n,
                                            TRUE ~ n))
```

A final check on the data result prior to visualizing the data.

```{r preview-Data 2, echo = TRUE}
paged_table(pop2021_grouped)
```

## Data visualization (Age-Sex Pyramid)

Finally the data is visualized in the following code chuck with the steps listed below:

* The geom_col method is used to chart the grouped data as the grouped values are calculated in prior step.
* the axis label is manually overwritten to replace the negative values.
* Followed by flipping the coordinates to display as a age-sex pyramid.
* Labels and theme adjustments were then added for readability.


```{r generate gender sex pyramid, layout="l-page", fig.width= 15, fig.asp=0.618, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(pop2021_grouped, aes(x = AG, y = Pop2, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_col() + #, stat= "identity" 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = as.integer(seq(-200000, 200000, 25000)),
                     labels = as.integer(c(seq(200000,0, by = -25000), seq(25000, 200000, by = 25000)))) + 
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Population Numbers") +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ggtitle("Age-Sex Pyramid Singapore 2021") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                      color = "black",
                                      linetype = "solid"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.25,
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "lightgrey"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.10,
                                        linetype = 'solid',
                                        colour = "lightgrey"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10))
```


# 5.0 Compared to Tableau

Prior to this exercise similar graphs were generated using Tableau. In comparing the process of doing so, producing the visualization using programming methods allows the user to methodological check the data processing step by step before visualize the graphic. Compared to graphical iterative methods the user would be assure that figures presented in the final graphic would be as intended. The documentation of each step also allows other users to replicate the process easily by reading through the documentation and see how each line of code produces the final data and graphic presented. They could also leverage code for their own purpose. Lastly it also provides high level so customization for the user to add layers and graphic as required. 

However compared to tableau this process does require some familiarity with the code and knowledge of what is possible otherwise a user may not realize the graph could be generated in a certain way. Whereas a interactive graphic interface such as tableau would allow easier experimentation available options to drag and drop values.
